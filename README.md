### Comments
***

This app. demostrates a simple full-stack application with a front end using HTML and Components of the Materialize framework and a back-end implemented with Node.JS and Express. HTML templating is done with Handlebars. It was a challenge to program as it incorporates many different files that interact with one-another. Heroku deployment was the most difficult step for me. However, once coded and deployed, this was a fun app to style and see in action.
